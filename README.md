## Logic training JS WEEK 1

This assignment really helped me better understand JavaScript logic. I learned how to use conditionals, arrays, loops, and basic functions. The triangle exercise made me think more about how to validate data, and I also practiced useful methods. Although some things confused me at first, I now have more clarity and feel more comfortable programming in JS. It was good practice for continuing to learn.
